                You won't believe how easy it is to make homemade pretzels. With this 2-ingredient dough, you can have fresh, warm, and golden soft pretzels on your table in no time. Keep the toppings simple with melted butter and coarse salt, or take things over the top with cinnamon sugar or Parmesan Cheese. A quick bath in a baking soda solution will create the iconic, chewy crust you love from a soft pretzel.
